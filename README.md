My first ever game :)  IF you want to add anything, and please feel free, i'm only concentrating on variables, lists, dictionaries, sets, booleans, integers, floats, strings, loops, libraries, conditions, funtions, and objects.  So i'd appreciate if you only add those 
things, thanks :D

The controls to move are keyleft, keyright, and keydown to fire.
